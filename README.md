Welcome to the **EV Charging App**, an open-source iOS application built with UIKit for discovering and managing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This app is designed to be white-labeled, allowing companies to customize it with their branding, configure backend services (e.g., Firebase), and publish it to the App Store.

## Features
- **Charger Locator**: Find nearby EV charging stations using an interactive map.
- **User Authentication**: Sign in/out with Email.
- **Station Details**: View charger availability, type, and pricing.
- **White-Label Ready**: Easily customize UI, colors, and logos for your brand.

## Prerequisites
- **Xcode**: Version 15.0 or later.
- **iOS**: Minimum deployment target of iOS 13.0.
- **Firebase Account**: Required for analytics.
- **CocoaPods**: Dependency manager (or use Swift Package Manager if preferred).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/powerly-ev/open-ev-charge-ios-app.git
cd <your-repo-name>

### 2. Install Dependencies
Using CocoaPods:
```bash
pod install
```
Open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

### 3. Configure Firebase
1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
3. Add it to the root of your Xcode project.
4. Enable Firebase services (e.g., Authentication, Firestore) in the Firebase console.
5. Update `AppDelegate.swift` or equivalent to initialize Firebase:
   ```swift
   import Firebase
   FirebaseApp.configure()
   ```

### 4. White-Labeling
To customize the app for your company:
- **Branding**: Replace assets in `Assets.xcassets` (e.g., app icon, logo).
- **Colors**: Update `UIColor` values in `Assets.xcassets/Color` or equivalent.
- **Strings**: Modify `Localizable.strings` for app-specific text.
- **Bundle ID**: Change the bundle identifier in `Config/OpenSource` to match your App Store account.

### 5. Build and Run
- Open `Powerly.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
- Select your target device/simulator.
- Press `Cmd + R` to build and run.

## White-Labeling Guide
Companies can use this app as a base for their own branded EV charging solution:
1. **Firebase Setup**: Replace `GoogleService-Info.plist` with your own.
